### Test Framework Design

**CTest Integration:** Uses `add_prerequisite_test()` function for process isolation  
**Execution Model:** Each test runs in separate CMake process (essential for testing dual execution)  
**Mock Strategy:** CMake scripts for external tool mocking  
**Validation Approach:** Counter-based verification with failure assertions  

## Comprehensive Test Coverage Analysis

### WELL TESTED FEATURES (25% of documented functionality)

#### Core Execution Model
- **Immediate execution** - Commands run during configure time before `project()`
- **Deferred execution** - Build targets created after `project()`  
- **Configure-time detection** - Correctly identifies nested CMake contexts (CTest)
- **Dual execution integration** - Same commands work in both modes

#### Stamp File System
- **Incremental builds** - Commands don't re-execute when stamps exist
- **Missing stamp recovery** - Rebuilds when stamp files deleted
- **Cross-reconfiguration persistence** - Stamps respected across cmake reconfigurations  
- **Execution counting verification** - Tests FAIL if commands run more than once

#### File Dependency Tracking (BUILD_DEPENDS only)
- **Basic file behavior** - File modifications trigger rebuilds
- **New file detection** - Analysis of GLOB expansion timing issues
- **Untracked file behavior** - Files outside patterns don't trigger rebuilds
- **File vs stamp comparison** - Direct behavioral comparison

#### Variable Substitution (Basic Variables Only)  
- **@PREREQUISITE_NAME@** - Prerequisite name substitution
- **@PREREQUISITE_BINARY_DIR@** - Build directory path substitution
- **@PREREQUISITE_SOURCE_DIR@** - Source directory path substitution

#### Command Types (BUILD_COMMAND Focus)
- **BUILD_COMMAND** - Extensively tested with counters, file tracking, timestamps
- **DOWNLOAD_COMMAND** - Basic execution testing only
- **INSTALL_COMMAND** - Basic execution testing only

### UNTESTED DOCUMENTED FEATURES (75% of functionality)

#### Download Source Options (CRITICAL GAP)
```cmake
# COMPLETELY UNTESTED
GIT_REPOSITORY <url>          # No Git download testing

UPDATE_COMMAND <cmd...>       # No update step testing
CONFIGURE_COMMAND <cmd...>    # No configure step testing  
TEST_COMMAND <cmd...>         # No test step testing
```

```

#### Property System (MINIMAL TESTING)

# BASIC FUNCTION EXISTS, LIMITED TESTING
Prerequisite_Get_Property()   # Minimal property access testing
```

#### Inter-Prerequisite Dependencies (BASIC IMPLEMENTATION)
```cmake
# LIMITED TESTING
DEPENDS <prereqs...>          # Multi-prerequisite dependency chains untested
```

## Critical Test Infrastructure Gaps

### 1. External Tool Mocking (NEEDED FOR UNTESTED FEATURES)
**Current:** Only CMake script mocks  
**Missing:** Git, wget, curl, tar, zip executable mocks  
**Impact:** Cannot test download sources without real external tools  

### 2. Error Condition Testing (MAJOR SECURITY/ROBUSTNESS GAP)
**Current:** Basic success path testing only  
**Missing:** Network failures, authentication errors, corrupt downloads, build failures  
**Impact:** Error handling untested, failure recovery unknown  

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing (MINIMAL COVERAGE)
**Current:** Linux-only testing (CMAKE_COMMAND assumptions)  
**Missing:** Windows (.exe extensions), macOS, different generators  
**Impact:** Platform compatibility unknown  

### 4. Performance and Scale Testing (NOT ADDRESSED)
**Current:** Simple single-prerequisite tests  
**Missing:** Large file handling, complex dependency chains, parallel execution  
**Impact:** Performance characteristics unknown  

## Implementation Priority for Test Expansion

### Phase 1: Core Feature Completion (IMMEDIATE)

├── many_files/             # File dependency tracking with thousands of files
├── deep_dependencies/      # Long prerequisite chains
└── parallel_execution/     # Concurrent prerequisite handling
```

## Mock Strategy Expansion

### Current Mocking (CMake Scripts Only)
- Simple file creation mocks
- Execution counting verification
- Basic timestamp manipulation

### Required Mock Additions

#### Git Mock Executable
```bash
# Mock git that creates realistic repository structures
mock_git clone <url> <dir>     # Creates .git/ and files
mock_git checkout <tag>        # Updates files, changes timestamps
mock_git --version             # Version identification
```

#### URL Download Mocks  
```bash
# Mock wget/curl that creates downloaded files
mock_wget <url> -O <file>      # Creates file with expected content
mock_curl <url> > <file>       # Alternative download tool
```

#### Archive Handling Mocks
```bash
# Mock tar/unzip for extraction testing
mock_tar -xzf <archive>        # Extracts to expected structure
mock_unzip <archive>           # Alternative extraction
```

## Test Quality Standards

### Assertion Requirements
- **Execution counting** - Tests MUST fail if commands run incorrect number of times
- **File verification** - Tests MUST verify expected files created with correct content
- **Timestamp validation** - Tests MUST verify dependency timestamp relationships
- **Error message validation** - Tests MUST verify appropriate error messages

### Test Isolation Requirements
- **Directory isolation** - Each test in separate directory
- **Process isolation** - Each test in separate CMake process (already implemented)
- **Environment isolation** - Tests must not affect each other
- **Cleanup verification** - Tests must clean up completely

### Performance Requirements
- **Individual test speed** - No test should take >30 seconds
- **Total suite time** - Full suite should complete in <10 minutes
- **Parallel execution** - Tests must be parallelizable

## Success Criteria for Complete Test Suite

The Prerequisites test suite will be complete when:

1. **Feature Coverage**: All documented Prerequisite.cmake features have corresponding tests
2. **Error Coverage**: All documented error conditions are tested  
3. **Platform Coverage**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility verified
4. **Generator Coverage**: Unix Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio, Xcode tested
5. **Scale Coverage**: Large projects and complex dependency chains tested
6. **Integration Coverage**: Real-world scenarios with multiple prerequisites tested

**Current Status**: 25% complete (core functionality well-tested)  
**Estimated Completion**: 18-24 months with focused development  
**Critical Path**: Download sources → Multi-step workflows → Logging system  

The foundation is excellent. The major work ahead is expanding test coverage to match the comprehensive documented feature set rather than fixing architectural issues.
